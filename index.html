    <h1>Get to know a little bit about me.</h1>

<p>My name is Julia (Jules) Proctor, and I created this site to document some of my favorite things I've learned through my educational and career-related pursuits.
    Check out <a href="/aboutme/">About Me</a> to get to know my interests and background. I've documented some of my favorite personal projects
    under <a href="/projects/">Projects.</a>
