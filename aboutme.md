Hi! My name is Julia Proctor. I made this website to showcase some of my favorite projects and problems I've worked on.

### My background

I have a B.S. in Engineering Physics from Cornell University and am pursuing a Master of Engineering in Aerospace Engineering from Cornell University. During my undergrad, I discovered my passion for guidance, navigation, and control, as it pulls together the most exciting topics of physics, mathematics, and computer science.
